# sqlalchemy-challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.

## Analysis: 
SqlAlchemy is a fun tool we learned that allows us to use SQL within Python. This is much perferable to me as it allows us to combine what we learned in Python with what we learned in SQL. 

This assignment was straightforward as a lot of SQLAlchemy stuff is standard and repeated each time. I had a bit of difficulties with the plots as it has been some time since I have plotted. 

Flask was fun to use also to translate our data/analysis into a "website".
